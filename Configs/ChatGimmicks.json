What you're referring to as @REPLACEMENT1@, is in fact, GNU/@REPLACEMENT1@, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus @REPLACEMENT1@. @REPLACEMENT1@ is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\nMany computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it.  Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called \"@REPLACEMENT1@\", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\nThere really is a @REPLACEMENT1@, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.  @REPLACEMENT1@ is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system.  @REPLACEMENT1@ is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with @REPLACEMENT1@ added, or GNU/@REPLACEMENT1@.  All the so-called \"@REPLACEMENT1@\" distributions are really distributions of GNU/@REPLACEMENT1@."

This Claim is ofcourse another attempt by the Socialist media to try and further confuse the youth about their gender so i took it upon myself to destroy that claim with facts and logic. Ofcourse the first thing i did was call my wife and ask for a quick discussion about the subject matter which she almost instantly agreed to after i informed her of the very sensitive topic at hand. So after i informed her of the nature of this discussion, my wife (who is a medical doctor) assured me that 'Pee' is infact not stored in the 'Balls' but in the organ called 'Bladder'. She also reassured me about the rediculousnes of the original statement as Women do also Urinate yet have no such thing as a scrotum or 'Balls', the only genital anatomy shared between men and woman beeing in the womb, when the clitoris has not yet formed into a Penis. To not further annoy my wife with such an irellevant topic i ended the conversation not digging deeper into the female anatomy, neither the topic of whatever that clitoris was as it has no impact concerning the topic at hand. Now, Secondly, i myself have made observations that will logically disprove the claim that ''pee is stored in the balls''. ive made these observations due to me often going to the toilet, using a urinal, while there is another man relieving himself next to me, especially at concert venues due to me beeing a concert level violinist, but i digress. now after staning next to multiple men and making carefull observations of my urinating neighbors i observed that even with a large ammount of urin beeing excreted from the mans penis, his Scrotum did not change in size significantly enough for such a large volume of fluid to be physicly contained in these mens 'balls'.

Typically, in fora such as this, I am met with ad-hominem mudslinging, anything from “You racist creep” or “Is that your real voice?” to raucous schoolyard laughter and threats of the dreaded “toilet swirly.” However, your willingness to engage with me over the phone on the subject of pizza shows an intellectual fortitude and openness to dangerous ideas which reflects highly on your character. Huzzah, good sir. Huzzah.\nSecond, any pizza I order will be male. None of this “Our pizza identifies as trans-fluid-pan-poly”—no. Pizza is a boy. With a penis. It’s that simple. It’s been true for all of human history, from Plato to Socrates to Mr. Mistoffelees, and any attempt to rewrite the pillars of Western thought will be met with a hearty “Fuh!” by yours truly. And, trust me, that is not a fate you wish to meet.\nNow. With regard to my topping preference. I have eaten from your pizzeria in times past, and it must be said: your pepperoni is embarrassingly spicy. Frankly, it boggles the mind. I mean, what kind of drugs are you inhaling over there? Pot?! One bite of that stuff and I had to take a shower. So tread lightly when it comes to spice, my good man. You do not want to see me at my most epic. Like the great white hero of Zack Snyder’s classic film “300,” I will kick you.\nOnions, peppers—no, thank you. If I wanted veggies, I’d go to a salad bar. I’m not some sort of vegan, Cory Booker weirdo. And your efforts to Michelle Obama-ize the great American pizza pie are, frankly, hilarious. Though not as funny as the impressively named P’Zone—when I finally figured out that genuinely creative pun, I laughed until I cried and peed. A true Spartan admits defeat, and I must admit that, in this instance, your Hut humor slayed me, Dennis Miller style.\nAnd, with that, you have earned my order. Congratulations. Ahem.

                ,"Holy shit. I am fucking turned on by grapes. Whenever I feel the soft, slimy outer skin, I get turned on. I slowly peel off the wet skin of a green grape, and start to feel its inner flesh. I squeeze the grape onto my dick and feel aroused as the grape crushes against my rock hard boner. I ejaculate my cock with the grape in my hand and feel pleasured as my dick is penetrated by the grape seeds. In a clash of flavor, I begin to climax, with the grape seeds getting shot out at the window, shattering the glass. I then stack a pile of grapes which i sit on. As the grapes enter my ass, I begin to shit out cum, shit, and grape juice all at once on the floor. When I run out of grapes, I contemplate suicide and begin to hang myself until the noose breaks due to my weight, and I begin to ejaculate again with more grapes."
                ,"Futa hentai is the best and totally not gay. On the contrary, it's actually double straight, even more straight than vanilla hentai. Futas have all the sex organs: dick, vag, boobs. That's 66.6% straight and 33.3 (repeating, of course) % gay if you don't like futas. However, the dick and vag cancel out mathematically and we're left with nothing but female boobs, which is 100% straight. On top of that, the male g spot is in the ass. Getting your g spot pounded by a man is gay. Getting your g spot pounded by a fat twelve inch futa cock is straight because there's a vagina somewhere back there and boobs that can rest on your back, plus the math checked out. There are only two types of men: men who want a fat futa cock railing their throat and dumping a hot load into their stomach followed by hours upon hours of anal, and men who are in denial."

A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. It's Shrek. I'm so happy. He whispers in my ear, \"This is my swamp\". He grabs me with his powerful ogre hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Shrek. He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Shrek. I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please Shrek. He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my butt with his love. My dad walks in.

                ,"Do british people actually exist? I mean, they must be a meme, there is a not a single thing about them. And I mean it. Let's go through the evidence: Where are they from? Not a single country in the world is named Britain. Some people say they come from England, and England is inside Britain, but if that was the case they would be British they would be Englanders. Also, heard some silly theories about them coming from whales. Guys, no, whale people do not exist. Whales live in the sea. There is a consensus on british people coming from Europe, but then we are left with a whole continent of possible locations. That's as good as nothing. What do they eat? Every country has at least one main dish. Even the US has their burgers. But these british people, what do they eat? Heard some people associating them with tea, but everyone knows that's an Asian thing. Shouldn't they come from Europe? One of these two points must be wrong them. To me, it looks too sketchy. What language do they speak? I challenge you, putting all my money and my ass on the line here, to find a supposed \"british\" person speaking their native language. Most of then just speak a broken ENGLISH. Yes, english. Really suspicious, huh? And I even tried to look deeper into it. Maybe british just SOUND like english, just like spanish could sound like portuguese for a non-speaker. So I looked up \"british dictionary on google\" and what I found was shocking: every word in there was AMERICAN. I kid you not. What this could mean is beyond my capabilities, but I can safely assure you that british people do not exist."

I guess it wasn't too bad, but I did the math and figured out that I sold a lot more food than I got paid for, even when you account for the price of the food. When I tried to talk to him about it, he said we're all part of one big team, but some people get paid more than others. This is suspiciously close to the famous quote: \"some are more equal than others\" from my favourite book, Animal Farm and is what got me thinking about this. We make money, and then he takes it and gives it to someone else who doesn't even work! I'm no economist, but this is textbook socialism. I think I've come to the conclusion that the best way for me to combat these socialistic businesses practices would be teaming up with my fellow workers unify out power and demonstrate that we understand the full value of our labour.

While many believe yeet to be a fairly new concept, it has been around for centuries. Think back to the berserker warriors. They would be so immersed in pushing all their power into their attack that they wouldn't even register pain, or go into shock, until long after a regular fighter would have passed out. They were true yeeters. A more modern example is the common use of warp speed in science fiction. It's interstellar yeet.

                ,"According to my scientific studies, Peeing with a boner is more difficult than giving birth. I am being 100 percent serious when I say this. This shouldn't even be an unpopular opinion, people just don't think about what the word \"difficult\" actually means. Peeing with a boner is more difficult than giving birth. Giving birth is definitely more painful, but pain by itself does not make something difficult. For example, putting my hand in a fire is not difficult, but it would hurt a lot. In order for something to be difficult, there has to be some chance of failure due to lack of skill, practice, or technique. Peeing with a boner often requires creative problem solving skills, especially in small spaces. There is no creative problem solving aspect of giving birth. Additionally, the way humans have evolved for these two actions supports my point. Giving birth is a natural process, which humans have evolved to be able to do. The female body is literally designed so that it can give birth with the lowest possible chance of error. The only real error that can happen is a miscarriage, which is also a natural occurrence, not a failure that occurs due to a lack of skill in giving birth. The male body, on the other hand, has evolved specifically so that peeing with a boner is very difficult. The only purpose for having a boner is to impregnate a woman, so the male body evolved to prevent urination during sex. On top of the difficulty in simply getting the pee to flow, there's the issue of actually positioning yourself so that the boner is pointing into the toilet bowl (urinals are much easier, but not always an option). In the past, I have had to give up and wait until my boner goes away because it was simply too difficult to actually pee in the toilet. There has never been a case where a woman has tried to give birth after being pregnant for nine months, not been able to do it, and said \"fuck it\" and waited 3 more months to try again because it would be easier the second try. Giving birth happens, every single time, because it's a natural process - peeing with a boner is the opposite."

                ,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Lil Pump. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics, most of the lyrics will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Lil Pump's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realize that they're not just catchy- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Lil Pump truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Lil Pump's existential catchphrase \"ESKITIT\", which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Lil Pump's musical genius unfolds itself. What fools... how I pity them.
