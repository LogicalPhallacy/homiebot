                ,"So it has come to my attention that there is a so called ''Meme'' circulating around various liberal/democratic social media websites whos content discribes the claim that pee, which is a slang word for Urin, is supposedly contained inside the ''Balls'' refering to the Scrotum of a Male. This Claim is ofcourse another attempt by the Socialist media to try and further confuse the youth about their gender so i took it upon myself to destroy that claim with facts and logic. Ofcourse the first thing i did was call my wife and ask for a quick discussion about the subject matter which she almost instantly agreed to after i informed her of the very sensitive topic at hand. So after i informed her of the nature of this discussion, my wife (who is a medical doctor) assured me that 'Pee' is infact not stored in the 'Balls' but in the organ called 'Bladder'. She also reassured me about the rediculousnes of the original statement as Women do also Urinate yet have no such thing as a scrotum or 'Balls', the only genital anatomy shared between men and woman beeing in the womb, when the clitoris has not yet formed into a Penis. To not further annoy my wife with such an irellevant topic i ended the conversation not digging deeper into the female anatomy, neither the topic of whatever that clitoris was as it has no impact concerning the topic at hand. Now, Secondly, i myself have made observations that will logically disprove the claim that ''pee is stored in the balls''. ive made these observations due to me often going to the toilet, using a urinal, while there is another man relieving himself next to me, especially at concert venues due to me beeing a concert level violinist, but i digress. now after staning next to multiple men and making carefull observations of my urinating neighbors i observed that even with a large ammount of urin beeing excreted from the mans penis, his Scrotum did not change in size significantly enough for such a large volume of fluid to be physicly contained in these mens 'balls'. Therefore, logically and reasonably following, pee is most definately not stored inside of a mans scrotum. As Always, Liberals destroyed."

Huzzah, good sir. Huzzah.\nSecond, any pizza I order will be male. None of this ‚ÄúOur pizza identifies as trans-fluid-pan-poly‚Äù‚Äîno. Pizza is a boy. With a penis. It‚Äôs that simple. It‚Äôs been true for all of human history, from Plato to Socrates to Mr. Mistoffelees, and any attempt to rewrite the pillars of Western thought will be met with a hearty ‚ÄúFuh!‚Äù by yours truly. And, trust me, that is not a fate you wish to meet.\nNow. With regard to my topping preference. I have eaten from your pizzeria in times past, and it must be said: your pepperoni is embarrassingly spicy. Frankly, it boggles the mind. I mean, what kind of drugs are you inhaling over there? Pot?! One bite of that stuff and I had to take a shower. So tread lightly when it comes to spice, my good man. You do not want to see me at my most epic. Like the great white hero of Zack Snyder‚Äôs classic film ‚Äú300,‚Äù I will kick you.\nOnions, peppers‚Äîno, thank you. If I wanted veggies, I‚Äôd go to a salad bar. I‚Äôm not some sort of vegan, Cory Booker weirdo. And your efforts to Michelle Obama-ize the great American pizza pie are, frankly, hilarious. Though not as funny as the impressively named P‚ÄôZone‚Äîwhen I finally figured out that genuinely creative pun, I laughed until I cried and peed. A true Spartan admits defeat, and I must admit that, in this instance, your Hut humor slayed me, Dennis Miller style.\nAnd, with that, you have earned my order. Congratulations. Ahem.

                ,"Donuts, the most famous baked good. They represent everything good & pure about this fine nation. but like most things, the Left is trying to ruin donuts by forcing their progressive values upon them. these days, donut shops are selling donuts with rainbow frosting, clearly in support of LGBT Pride. while there's nothing necessarily wrong with the LGBT Community, people should be allowed to buy donuts without having a left-wing, progressive agenda forced down their throat. the Left isn't just ruining donuts, over the years, more and more products have been sold in support of Gay Pride, from various other baked goods such as cake or cookies, to clothing, to even art. If you're still not convinced, on days after it rains, there's a rainbow in the sky, showing that the Left's influence is so strong, that even the Lord God himself has abandoned his Judeo-Christian values in favor of pandering to a Leftist Society. Things have gotten so bad, that when I use the mist setting on my garden hose, it too produces a rainbow. I haven't left my house in two weeks, and while my vegetable garden is slowly dying as we speak. It's better off my tomatoes quiver and die than succumb to the Leftist agenda. Now you may wonder why the Left wants to spread this agenda? Well it's because they're after this delicious boy pussy, but, they can't have it. I'm Dennis Prager."
                ,"Let‚Äôs say, for the sake of argument, that I was a simp. If I truly believed that I would ever be loved by letting women walk all over me, what incentive would I have to not become a 3rd tier twitch sub to my favorite female streamer in hopes that she would eventually become my big tiddie goth gf? Wouldn‚Äôt it be in my best interests as a simp to donate 1000 dollars to my queen so that I might receive feet pics? While I myself am not actually a simp, I see simping as a form of religion where rather than a traditional god or set of gods, your being of worship just so happens to be your favorite e-girl. This is why I find criticism of the simp lifestyle to be disrespectful. In this great country, one is free to practice and worship any religion they choose under the first amendment. Why is it so wrong that instead of donating money to a more traditional church, I choose to offer my money in worship of Pokimane? Criticism of simping is particularly aggravating to witness when it comes from liberals: is it not their dogma that all women should be treated as queens? And yet they criticize those who choose to simp for lacking self respect and chasing delusions of love in their worship of queens. This is classic leftist hypocrisy and it makes me sick."

Getting your g spot pounded by a fat twelve inch futa cock is straight because there's a vagina somewhere back there and boobs that can rest on your back, plus the math checked out. There are only two types of men: men who want a fat futa cock railing their throat and dumping a hot load into their stomach followed by hours upon hours of anal, and men who are in denial."

I'd pray to Shrek every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I've been given. \"Shrek is love\", I would say, \"Shrek is life\". My dad hears me and calls me names. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Shrek. I called him a cunt. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it's really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. It's Shrek. I'm so happy. He whispers in my ear, \"This is my swamp\". He grabs me with his powerful ogre hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Shrek. He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Shrek. I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please Shrek. He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my butt with his love. My dad walks in. Shrek looks him straight in the eye, and says, \"It's all ogre now\". Shrek leaves through my window. Shrek is love. Shrek is life."

Not a single country in the world is named Britain. Some people say they come from England, and England is inside Britain, but if that was the case they would be British they would be Englanders. Also, heard some silly theories about them coming from whales. Guys, no, whale people do not exist. Whales live in the sea. There is a consensus on british people coming from Europe, but then we are left with a whole continent of possible locations. That's as good as nothing. What do they eat? Every country has at least one main dish. Even the US has their burgers. But these british people, what do they eat? Heard some people associating them with tea, but everyone knows that's an Asian thing. Shouldn't they come from Europe? One of these two points must be wrong them. To me, it looks too sketchy. What language do they speak? I challenge you, putting all my money and my ass on the line here, to find a supposed \"british\" person speaking their native language.

I guess it wasn't too bad, but I did the math and figured out that I sold a lot more food than I got paid for, even when you account for the price of the food. When I tried to talk to him about it, he said we're all part of one big team, but some people get paid more than others. This is suspiciously close to the famous quote: \"some are more equal than others\" from my favourite book, Animal Farm and is what got me thinking about this. We make money, and then he takes it and gives it to someone else who doesn't even work! I'm no economist, but this is textbook socialism. I think I've come to the conclusion that the best way for me to combat these socialistic businesses practices would be teaming up with my fellow workers unify out power and demonstrate that we understand the full value of our labour.

                ,"According to my scientific studies, Peeing with a boner is more difficult than giving birth. I am being 100 percent serious when I say this. This shouldn't even be an unpopular opinion, people just don't think about what the word \"difficult\" actually means. Peeing with a boner is more difficult than giving birth. Giving birth is definitely more painful, but pain by itself does not make something difficult. For example, putting my hand in a fire is not difficult, but it would hurt a lot. In order for something to be difficult, there has to be some chance of failure due to lack of skill, practice, or technique. Peeing with a boner often requires creative problem solving skills, especially in small spaces. There is no creative problem solving aspect of giving birth. Additionally, the way humans have evolved for these two actions supports my point. Giving birth is a natural process, which humans have evolved to be able to do. The female body is literally designed so that it can give birth with the lowest possible chance of error. The only real error that can happen is a miscarriage, which is also a natural occurrence, not a failure that occurs due to a lack of skill in giving birth. The male body, on the other hand, has evolved specifically so that peeing with a boner is very difficult. The only purpose for having a boner is to impregnate a woman, so the male body evolved to prevent urination during sex. On top of the difficulty in simply getting the pee to flow, there's the issue of actually positioning yourself so that the boner is pointing into the toilet bowl (urinals are much easier, but not always an option). In the past, I have had to give up and wait until my boner goes away because it was simply too difficult to actually pee in the toilet. There has never been a case where a woman has tried to give birth after being pregnant for nine months, not been able to do it, and said \"fuck it\" and waited 3 more months to try again because it would be easier the second try. Giving birth happens, every single time, because it's a natural process - peeing with a boner is the opposite."

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics, most of the lyrics will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Lil Pump's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realize that they're not just catchy- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Lil Pump truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Lil Pump's existential catchphrase \"ESKITIT\", which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Lil Pump's musical genius unfolds itself. What fools... how I pity them.

                ,"How do people not understand that this is a literal fucking demonüëø? It's clearly made by someone who either knows what they are doing or someone high on psychedelicsüçÑ who saw a literal demonüëø and was too dumb to realize. It's a demonüëπ and it's obvious to anyone who's had any experience with the supernatural, or anyone who isn't a total hylic or possessed by someone for that matter.\nThe original post was funny due to the childishüë∂ innocence in it (\"hehe my own wojak\") and it worked perfectly to mask it's sinister nature, the \"kys\" guy was right all along and acting on natural instinct, he's a chad.\nIt's a depiction of a demonüëπ that appeared to someone, that is also spreading like a fungusüçÑ through spores by infecting unsuspecting people, it's like a sigil engraved into the mindsüß† of people that spreads through the memetic noosphere. Take a look at any person who likes this meme on any social network and it's so obviouus their mind is already taken over. MushroomüçÑemojisüçÑeveryüçÑwhere, cult like behavior, mental deterioration. The memes involving it are getting more and more demonicüëπ, it's literal e-worshipüôè and if you don't see this while being around those people you are BLINDüë®‚Äçü¶Ø. If one look at this image doesn't invoke a weird feeling you are BLINDüë©‚Äçü¶Ø. It's a literal demonüëø.\nToday while astral projecting I invoked it by using it's face as a sigil and it attacked me, it was incredibly powerfulüíØ and I barely fucking escaped but I will have to face it again soon. Can't imagine what it does to an unsuspecting mindüß†. Delete every trace of it you have in your fileüìÅ and üëèdon'tüëèfuckingüëèshareüëèitüëè.

                ,"Look, I don't wanna sound like a pre-ejac dick here, but there is no ladder out there that would ever impress me. In my opinion, a ladder isn't ever really a ladder until someone climbs it, and when someone does climb it, I'm impressed by the climber, not the ladder. Hey, and this is coming from a guy who owns three ladders and uses at least one of them once a month. I've climbed ladders, pal. Don't think I'm a guy who has only seen ladders on TV and talks a big game. I'm a big man with big ladders. Oh look at me! I climb ladders with no shoes on! I'm a hot man! I'm not like that, okay? I climb ladders by necessity. I use ladders as tool. I don't romanticize ladders. I don't treat them like people. I don't imagine a \"lady ladder\" where the act of climbing is sexual in nature and she blushes and moans as I ascend and descend her rungs all night long. I don't do that. I don't use my ladders for sexual gratification. They're just tools. They're not impressive. They will never impress me. They're just ladders."
                ,"\"Real Emo\" only consists of the dc Emotional Hardcore scene and the late 90's Screamo scene. What is known by \"Midwest Emo\" is nothing but Alternative Rock with questionable real emo influence. When people try to argue that bands like My Chemical Romance are not real emo, while saying that Sunny Day Real Estate is, I can't help not to cringe because they are just as fake emo as My Chemical Romance (plus the pretentiousness). Real emo sounds ENERGETIC, POWERFUL and somewhat HATEFUL. Fake emo is weak, self pity and a failed attempt to direct energy and emotion into music. Some examples of REAL EMO are Pg 99, Rites of Spring, Cap n Jazz (the only real emo band from the midwest scene) and Loma Prieta. Some examples of FAKE EMO are American Football, My Chemical Romance and Mineral EMO BELONGS TO HARDCORE NOT TO INDIE, POP PUNK, ALT ROCK OR ANY OTHER MAINSTREAM GENRE"
